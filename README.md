## Design Pillars:

Adventurous. 

## Genre/Story/Mechanics Summary:

In Not An Average Night, you take the role of an average person and live through their dreams. Some may be simple and peaceful, such as trimming tall grass, while others can be nightmares that you need to navigate your way out of. Whatever happens to you in these nightmares, remember that if you die in dreams, you just wake back up.



## Features: 

Walk around your room and go to sleep, starting a playthrough.

In a playthrough, navigate through a dream. Your dream can be just doing something relaxing, a puzzle or a nightmare where you fight to survive and navigate your way out of a dangerous situation.

Upon waking up, you’ll find yourself back in your room with posters of your completed dreams exhibited on your wall. Enjoy the success you achieved in your dream!

You have the option to go back to sleep or exit your room (and also the game).



## Controls: 

A,D - Basic movement, left and right

W - Jump

Left Shift - Slide

E - Interact

Space - Hit/Attack/Block

## Art Style:

Not An Average Night’s artstyle is based on 2D pixel-art games, such as the Kingdom series. 



## Music/Sound:

Our music and sound effects were chosen depending on the situation they were needed for. As such, there’s no specific inspiration for them.
